I was born and raised in the lovely city of Curitiba, Brazil. In fact, if I were to live in Brazil, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. But the truth is I don't live in Brazil for a couple of years now, haven chosen to spend most of my days in Israel and Haifa has been my home so far.

One things I miss the most about Brazil (apart from my family and friends obviously) is the exciting world of craft beers. Every once in a while you discover that there is a new craft brewery in your city, a new beer garden in your neighborhood, a friend that decided to take up homebrewing as a new hobby...

Besides talking about beer (which I try not to do much and fail), I am intrigued by how cities are developing and our role as in their development. During my master's studies, I was exposed to a new paradigm of last-mile delivery in urban environments and I couldn't stop reading about smart cities ever since and I would be extremely excited to be part of this movement somehow.

If any of this appeals to you, please contact me by e-mail or by my LinkedIn profile. If not, thanks for stopping by anyways :)
